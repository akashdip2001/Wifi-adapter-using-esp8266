To create a WiFi adapter using an ESP8266 microcontroller, you can follow these general steps:

1) Gather the Required Hardware: 
  - ESP8266 module (e.g., ESP-01, NodeMCU, or Wemos D1 Mini).
  - USB to Serial adapter (for programming and debugging).
  - Power supply (e.g., USB cable or batteries).
  - Breadboard and jumper wires (if needed).

 2) Install Arduino IDE:
  - Download and install the Arduino IDE if you haven't already.

 3) Install ESP8266 Board Support:
  - Open the Arduino IDE, go to "File" > "Preferences," and add this URL to the Additional Boards Manager URLs: http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
  - Go to "Tools" > "Board" > "Boards Manager," search for "esp8266" and install the support for the ESP8266 boards.

 4) Select the ESP8266 Board:
  - Go to "Tools" > "Board" and select your specific ESP8266 module.

 5) Write the Code:
  - Write your code in the Arduino IDE. You can use the Arduino language to program the ESP8266.
  - Use the ESP8266WiFi library to configure the WiFi settings.

 6) Upload the Code:
  - Connect your ESP8266 module to your computer via the USB to Serial adapter.
  - Select the correct COM port in the Arduino IDE.
  - Click the "Upload" button to upload your code to the ESP8266.

 7) Testing:
  - After uploading, open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the ESP8266's serial output.
  - You should see the ESP8266 connecting to the WiFi network if your code is correct.

 8) Configure as an Adapter:
  - Depending on your specific project, you can configure the ESP8266 to act as a WiFi adapter. For example, you can connect it to other microcontrollers or devices and use it to communicate over WiFi.


# Here's the code to get you started with configuring the ESP8266 as a WiFi adapter:

```
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>

const char* ssid = "AkashdipMahapatra_YouTube";
const char* password = "YourWiFiPassword";

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(1000);
    Serial.println("Connecting to WiFi...");
  }
  Serial.println("Connected to WiFi");
}

void loop() {
  // Your code here
}
```

- Replace "AkashdipMahapatra_YouTube" and "YourWiFiPassword" with your actual WiFi network credentials. This code will connect the ESP8266 to the specified WiFi network.
- Remember that you can use the ESP8266 for various IoT projects as a WiFi adapter to connect to the internet or communicate with other devices on your network. The specific application will dictate the code and functionality you need to implement.



# Monitor mode

The ESP8266 is not well-suited for monitor mode (promiscuous mode) as it's primarily designed for connecting to WiFi networks and lacks dedicated monitor mode capabilities found in some other Wi-Fi chipsets. However, you can perform some basic packet sniffing using ESP8266 in a limited way.

Here's a simple example of how to capture and display WiFi packets using an ESP8266 in "promiscuous mode":

```
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>

void promiscuousCallback(uint8_t *buf, uint16_t len) {
  // Process and display the captured packet
  Serial.write(buf, len);
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  wifi_set_opmode(STATION_MODE);
  wifi_set_channel(1);  // Set the channel you want to monitor

  wifi_promiscuous_enable(0);
  wifi_set_promiscuous_rx_cb(promiscuousCallback);
  wifi_promiscuous_enable(1);
}

void loop() {
  // Your code here
}
```

- Please note that the ESP8266's ability to capture and process packets in promiscuous mode is quite limited compared to dedicated Wi-Fi monitoring devices. ESP8266's main design focus is on connecting to Wi-Fi networks.
- Additionally, enabling promiscuous mode and capturing Wi-Fi packets in this way may raise legal and ethical concerns. Be sure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in your region when using such functionality.
- If you require more advanced packet capture and analysis, you might want to consider using dedicated Wi-Fi monitoring hardware or other platforms designed for such tasks.
